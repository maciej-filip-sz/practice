    <p>Otto looks very strong, if a little corpulent. He wears a huge beard, which reaches his chest. His beard needs to be trimmed, but this is not possible, because the easily excited otter vigorously resist such a procedure. The beard could perhaps be trimmed during his sleep, but no one has the courage to try this.</p>
